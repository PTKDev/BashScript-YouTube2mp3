# youtube2mp3: A very simple system to download YouTube music videos and convert them to mp3 files

This is a very simple and short Bash script to provide a GUI for downloading
YouTube music videos and convert them to MP3 files. I developed this for my
personal use (and to help a few friends) and then thought it would be helpful to
others, too. So here it is.

The script currently depends on zenity, youtube-dl and ffmpeg. I have
tested it on Ubuntu GNU/Linux machines.

## How to Install

- Run install.sh

Alternatively you can simply make youtube2mp3.sh executable and then run:

    ./youtube2mp3.sh

on the command line (or create a shortcut to it for easier access).

Installation system and bitrate selection support has been added by
